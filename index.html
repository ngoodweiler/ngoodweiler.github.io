    <h1>Hello World! <br>
    </h1>
    <p>
      <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/200/people" alt="Here's a picture of me!"> <br>
      My name is Nolan Goodweiler
      I like long walks on the beach and puppies <br>
      I am currently 29 years old and have a wife, Adrianna, 2 sons, Dimitri and Giovanni, and 2 Shiba Inus, Zorro and Arya <br>
      Zorro got his name because he looks like a red fox (and zorro means fox in spanish if you didnt know that) <br>
      Arya got her name because she is small and feisty, just like Arya from A Game of Thrones
      <br>

    <p>
      I am in the Data Analytics Boot Camp at DU right now, trying to learn something new and move into a Data Scientist role. <br>
      Currently I am a Senior Metallurgist for Climax Molybdenum at the Henderson Mill. I have a degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines. <br>
      I am getting tired of this type of role, and have always been good at data anlysis with MS Excel and Minitab, but I know that learning how to code will let me work off my strengths and move into a new industry.
